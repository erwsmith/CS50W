# Python

Python is a programming language that can be used both for writing **command-line scripts** or building **web applications**.

## Data analysis and machine learning

Python has become a staple in data science, allowing [data analysts](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-analyst-do-a-career-guide) and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks.

Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots. Python also has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.

## Web development

Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application—the parts that a user doesn’t see. Python’s role in web development can include sending data to and from servers, processing data and communicating with databases, URL routing, and ensuring security. Python offers several frameworks for web development. Commonly used ones include Django and Flask.

Some web development jobs that use Python include back end engineers, full stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps engineers.
